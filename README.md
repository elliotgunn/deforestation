We obtained deforestation data from the World Bank.

- "We used random forest machine learning and logistic
regression to predict forest loss risk in the 2000â€“2010
time period from landscape conditions in 2000,
separately for each nation within the study area
(Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia), to assess how the
drivers of deforestation may differ between nations."
